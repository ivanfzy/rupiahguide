# Welcome to RupiahGuide

We created this tool because **Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)** can be confusing. With so many zeros, it's easy to mix up a 10,000 note with a 100,000 note if you aren't paying attention.

## Why use this app?

1. **Visualizer**: See exactly what bills you should get.
2. **Counter**: Count your cash quickly before you leave the ATM or money changer.
3. **Real-time Rates**: We use AI to get fresh exchange rates.

Stay safe and enjoy your trip!
