Many currency exchange scams depend on one critical moment: you choose to stay and complete the transaction because you feel "already committed" or "don't want to be rude." Yet the safest action is often to cancel and walk away before money fully changes hands.

This article teaches you which [red flags](avoid-scam) demand you walk away—and how to exit gracefully without creating problems. See our guide on [10 common money exchange scams](avoid-scam) for specific scam tactics.

## The Non-Negotiable Baseline: Licensed Changer

A legitimate, licensed money changer displays clear signs: the "PVA Berizin / Pedagang Valuta Asing Berizin" logo (Bank Indonesia licensed) and displayed business authorization documents.

**How to check:**
- Look at walls/counter for the PVA Berizin logo
- Find posted certification or business license (usually framed, clearly displayed)
- If you're unsure, ask: "Do you have official Bank Indonesia authorization?"
- If they can't show proper documentation or seem evasive, that's your first red flag

**If there's no visible license:** Treat it as high risk and find another changer. Licensed changers are abundant in tourist areas and major cities; there's no reason to take the risk.

## Red Flags (Ranked From "Pay Attention" to "Exit Immediately")

### RED FLAG #1: Rate Far Higher Than Normal

**What it is:**
The display board shows a rate significantly higher than competitors nearby, or dramatically higher than the mid-market rate you see on apps like XE or OANDA.

**Why it's dangerous:**
"Too good" rates are classic bait. After you hand over money, they'll:
- Claim "That rate only applies to certain denominations, not yours"
- Suddenly introduce large "admin fees"
- Change the agreed terms with new excuses
- Hand you far less rupiah than promised

**Example:**
- Mid-market rate: USD 1 = Rp16.500
- App rate (XE): Rp16.300–16.400
- Competitors nearby: Rp16.200–16.300
- They offer: Rp16.800 or Rp17.000

This won't materialize. It's bait.

**What to do:**
- Don't debate or negotiate
- Simply say "Thank you" and walk to another money changer
- Or ask: "What's my final rate after all fees?" and see how they answer

### RED FLAG #2: No Written Receipt (Slip) Showing Details

**What it is:**
When you request the transaction, they don't offer or refuse to provide a written slip showing:
- Your foreign currency amount
- The rate being used
- The total rupiah you'll receive

**Why it's dangerous:**
Without written proof, there's no record of the agreement. They can change any number without evidence. If something's wrong later, you have no reference to claim against.

Professional money changers always provide this (even small ones)—it's standard practice and legal protection.

**What to do:**
- Ask before money is counted: "Can I get a slip showing the amount, rate, and total rupiah?"
- If they refuse or hesitate, cancel immediately
- Don't proceed without a slip—it's non-negotiable

### RED FLAG #3: You're Not Given Time to Recount

**What it is:**
After the operator counts and hands you money, they:
- Immediately say "Done, thank you, goodbye!"
- Try to move you out quickly
- Don't allow you time to verify the count
- Make you feel rushed or pressured to leave

**Why it's dangerous:**
Short-changing commonly happens here. They bet you won't recount at the counter, so you'll discover you're short only later (too late to claim).

**Specific scam to watch for—Mixing Denominations:**
A common tactic in Indonesia is slipping **Rp10,000 bills (purple) into stacks of Rp100,000 bills (red)**. Tourists unfamiliar with the currency often don't notice the color difference immediately. Always check every bill—if you expected Rp100,000 × 50 = Rp5,000,000 but receive 45 × Rp100,000 + 50 × Rp10,000, you've lost Rp500,000.

**What to do:**
- Say firmly: "Wait, let me count first" and don't move
- Use your [bundling verification method](understanding-rupiah) (see [Understanding Rupiah](understanding-rupiah))
- **Separate by denomination:** Stack all Rp100,000 together, all Rp50,000 together, etc. Count each stack separately
- Take your time; don't feel rushed
- If they show impatience or annoyance, recount extra carefully—that's a sign something's wrong

### RED FLAG #4: Distraction From Others (Team Distraction)

**What it is:**
While you're transacting:
- Someone suddenly appears to chat with you
- An uninvolved staff member stands nearby watching
- Sudden noise or commotion distracts you
- Pressure to hurry ("Don't take long, other customers waiting")

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is the "distraction team" scam technique. They make you lose focus while cash is being counted, so you don't know how much was actually counted.

**What to do:**
- Stop conversation firmly: "Excuse me, I need to focus on the money"
- If the person doesn't leave, ask the operator to remove them
- If they refuse your request, cancel the transaction
- Remember: you're the customer; the changer should accommodate your needs

### RED FLAG #5: Counting Is "Too Fast" or Piles Constantly Shuffled

**What it is:**
- Operator counts with extreme speed (flash counting)
- Piles are moved around constantly during counting
- You can't follow the amount being tallied
- No organized arrangement by denomination

**Why it's dangerous:**
Fast counting + shuffled piles = perfect setup for sleight of hand (palming notes). Some bills can disappear without you knowing.

**Specific scam to watch for—The "Recount" Trick:**
After you've verified the amount, they offer: "Let me count once more to make absolutely sure." During this **second count**, they palm some bills (sleight-of-hand). You already saw the correct amount once, so you don't pay attention to the recount—and leave with less money.

**Never let them recount after you've verified.** Once you've confirmed the amount, the transaction is done.

**What to do:**
- Request organized counting: "Can you organize this by denomination?"
- Ask them to recount in a more orderly way
- **Critical:** After you verify the final count, say "Thank you" and put the money away immediately
- If they offer to "recount to make sure," decline firmly: "I've already counted. Thank you"
- If they refuse or say "not necessary," that's a red flag—cancel
- If they get visibly irritated at the request, something's definitely wrong

### RED FLAG #6: Fees or Charges Suddenly Appear

**What it is:**
- They quoted a good rate and promised a total rupiah amount
- Mid-transaction or at the end, new charges appear: "admin fee," "commission," "handling fee," or "tax"
- Your final amount is suddenly much less than promised

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is "bait and switch." They attract you with a good rate but hidden fees make the effective rate terrible—worse than competitors.

**Example:**
- Promised rate: Rp16.800 per USD
- Your amount: $300 = Rp5.040.000 (expected)
- Sudden "admin fee": Rp500.000
- You receive: Rp4.540.000 (effective rate: Rp15.133—much worse!)

**What to do:**
- Before handing money, ask: "Are there any fees or commissions?"
- If yes, ask details: "How much exactly?"
- Get the final amount (total rupiah) promised **before** cash is counted
- If fees are disappointing, cancel—don't proceed

### RED FLAG #7: Exchange Rate Changes Mid-Transaction

**What it is:**
- Initial agreement: Rate is Rp16.500 per USD
- Partway through (after money is in their hands), they announce:
  - "Your notes are actually older, so rate is lower"
  - "This denomination doesn't qualify for that rate"
  - "There's a fee I forgot to mention"

**Why it's dangerous:**
Pure psychological pressure. They're counting on you feeling "trapped" because your money is already with them, so you'll accept worse terms.

**What to do:**
- Immediately take your money back (before all of it is counted)
- Say clearly: "This is different from what we agreed. I'm canceling."
- Don't complete the transaction—walk to another changer
- If they resist giving your money back, this is very suspicious—ask for help or contact authorities

### RED FLAG #8: Location Feels Unsafe or Suspicious

**What it is:**
- Money changer is in a dark or isolated location
- No other people around (you're alone with staff)
- No visible security cameras or protection
- Looks like it's operating "under the table" (not formal)
- Staff seem hostile or unwelcoming from the start

**Why it's dangerous:**
Safe, legitimate places have security, CCTV, and other people. Sketchy locations indicate this isn't a formal operation.

**What to do:**
- Don't enter or leave immediately if you're inside
- Never exchange money here—risk is too high
- Find a changer in a busy area, mall, or inside a bank branch

### RED FLAG #9: They Can't Provide Correct Change

**What it is:**
- You request a specific denomination for your rupiah total
- They say "We don't have that denomination right now"
- They suggest you take different denominations instead
- Or they ask you to come back later

**Why it's dangerous:**
Serious money changers always have adequate denominations. If they can't, it signals:
- They're not a formal operation
- They're trying to avoid giving you what you negotiated
- Something's off about their setup

**What to do:**
- Don't compromise—you have the right to your requested [denominations](understanding-rupiah)
- If they truly can't accommodate, find another changer
- Don't accept an "alternative"; you earned the right to choose

### RED FLAG #10: Your Bills Are "Damaged" or Rejected

**What it is:**
After you hand over your foreign currency, they examine it and claim:
- "This bill has a small fold/corner damage"
- "The ink is slightly faded"
- "There's a minor mark on the edge"
- "Bank Indonesia won't accept this condition"

Then they offer:
- Lower rate for "damaged" bills
- Pressure you to accept anyway
- Or refuse to return your money until you agree to worse terms

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is a psychological tactic to create urgency and pressure. Your money is already in their hands, and now they've created a problem that didn't exist. Most travelers will accept worse terms just to get their money back.

**The reality:**
Major Indonesian banks (BCA, Mandiri, BNI) and legitimate money changers accept USD/EUR in normal circulated condition. Bills don't need to be pristine—minor wear is completely normal and acceptable.

**What to do:**
- Don't accept their assessment—minor folds and normal wear are acceptable everywhere
- Demand your money back: "Please return my bills. I'll go elsewhere"
- Never agree to a worse rate for normal wear
- If they refuse to return your money, this is extremely serious—contact authorities

### RED FLAG #11: Street Money Changers Approaching You

**What it is:**
Someone approaches you on the street, at the beach, near tourist attractions, or outside legitimate changers offering:
- "Better rate than the shop"
- "No commission, no waiting"
- "I can change right now, fast service"
- "Special rate just for you today"

They may:
- Be persistent and follow you
- Show a large stack of cash to appear legitimate
- Claim to "work for" a nearby money changer
- Operate from a backpack, motorbike, or hidden location

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is outright fraud or robbery setup. Common outcomes:
- **Counterfeit bills:** You receive fake or worthless Indonesian Rupiah
- **Shortchanging:** They count fast and you receive far less than promised
- **Theft:** They grab your money and run, or accomplices distract you while they steal
- **Switch:** They take your real bills and switch for damaged/worthless foreign currency

**There is no legitimate reason** for a money changer to approach you on the street. Licensed changers have proper locations, signage, and don't solicit.

**What to do:**
- **Never engage**—don't even stop to listen
- Say firmly: "No thank you" and keep walking
- Don't show your money or wallet
- If persistent, enter a shop, hotel, or busy area
- Report to security or police if they won't leave you alone

## How to Exit Gracefully

If you detect red flags and want to cancel:

**Method #1: Polite Decline**
- "Thank you, but I'll try another place"
- Or: "I appreciate it, but I'll look elsewhere"
- No need to explain details
- Just say thanks and leave

**Method #2: The "Let Me Check" Exit**
- "Let me quickly compare rates at another changer nearby"
- Leave and don't return
- Makes them feel less rejected

**Method #3: Direct but Professional**
- If already counting: "There's a discrepancy. I'm canceling this transaction."
- Not accusatory—just factual
- Take your money back and leave

**Method #4: If They Resist**
- If they won't return your money, stay calm
- Request it clearly: "Please return my currency"
- If still refused, contact your accommodation or police
- This is a very bad sign

## Don't Feel Guilty About Walking Away

This is critical: **You don't owe these people anything until the full exchange is complete.**

- Other changers are always nearby
- You're not obligated to complete any transaction
- Your safety instinct about "something being wrong" is usually correct
- Canceling is the smart choice, not a rude one

Many tourists complete sketchy transactions out of guilt or politeness, then get scammed. Don't be that person.

## Quick Decision Flowchart (Memorize This)

```
Licensed changer (PVA Berizin + visible certificate)?
├─ NO → WALK AWAY immediately
└─ YES → Check other red flags:
   ├─ Rate "too good" / no slip / rushed / distracted / fast counting
   ├─ / sudden fees / rate change / unsafe location / no proper change?
   │  ├─ YES (any of these) → WALK AWAY
   │  └─ NO (none of these) → Proceed (use 3-step counting method)
   └─ Done
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **License is the baseline** – PVA Berizin logo and certificate visible = eligible; otherwise, walk away
2. **"Too good" rates are bait** – Check real-time app rates; if it's too high, so is the risk. See [common scam tactics](avoid-scam).
3. **Written receipt is essential** – Never proceed without one; cancel if refused
4. **Distraction and pressure = red flags** – Cancel both
5. **Fast counting + shuffled piles = setup for fraud** – Request organized, orderly [counting](avoid-scam); **never let them recount after you've verified**
6. **Sudden fees are never good** – Know your final amount before any cash moves
7. **Rate changes mid-transaction = abort** – Get your money back immediately
8. **Unsafe location = don't go** – Find a changer in a secure, busy area
9. **"Damaged bill" excuse = pressure tactic** – Normal wear is acceptable; demand your money back
10. **Street changers approaching you = guaranteed scam** – Never engage; legitimate changers don't solicit
11. **Mixing denominations (Rp10k in Rp100k stack)** – Separate and count each denomination stack separately
12. **Don't feel obligated to proceed** – Walking away is the right choice if something feels off
13. **Other options always exist** – Never force yourself to use a suspicious changer out of convenience

## Final Word

Most currency exchange scams can be prevented by making the **right decision early**. Don't rely on hope or trust in kindness—use protocols, written evidence, and your instinct. If it feels wrong, it probably is. Walk away. No one will blame you, and you'll avoid a bad situation. Walking away is the safest, smartest move you can make.
