Many currency exchange scams depend on one critical moment: you choose to stay and complete the transaction because you feel "already committed" or "don't want to be rude." Yet the safest action is often to cancel and walk away before money fully changes hands.

This article teaches you which red flags demand you walk away—and how to exit gracefully without creating problems.

## The Non-Negotiable Baseline: Licensed Changer

A legitimate, licensed money changer displays clear signs: the "PVA Berizin / Pedagang Valuta Asing Berizin" logo (Bank Indonesia licensed) and displayed business authorization documents.

**How to check:**
- Look at walls/counter for the PVA Berizin logo
- Find posted certification or business license (usually framed, clearly displayed)
- If you're unsure, ask: "Do you have official Bank Indonesia authorization?"
- If they can't show proper documentation or seem evasive, that's your first red flag

**If there's no visible license:** Treat it as high risk and find another changer. Licensed changers are abundant in tourist areas and major cities; there's no reason to take the risk.

## Red Flags (Ranked From "Pay Attention" to "Exit Immediately")

### RED FLAG #1: Rate Far Higher Than Normal

**What it is:**
The display board shows a rate significantly higher than competitors nearby, or dramatically higher than the mid-market rate you see on apps like XE or OANDA.

**Why it's dangerous:**
"Too good" rates are classic bait. After you hand over money, they'll:
- Claim "That rate only applies to certain denominations, not yours"
- Suddenly introduce large "admin fees"
- Change the agreed terms with new excuses
- Hand you far less rupiah than promised

**Example:**
- Mid-market rate: USD 1 = Rp16.500
- App rate (XE): Rp16.300–16.400
- Competitors nearby: Rp16.200–16.300
- They offer: Rp16.800 or Rp17.000

This won't materialize. It's bait.

**What to do:**
- Don't debate or negotiate
- Simply say "Thank you" and walk to another money changer
- Or ask: "What's my final rate after all fees?" and see how they answer

### RED FLAG #2: No Written Receipt (Slip) Showing Details

**What it is:**
When you request the transaction, they don't offer or refuse to provide a written slip showing:
- Your foreign currency amount
- The rate being used
- The total rupiah you'll receive

**Why it's dangerous:**
Without written proof, there's no record of the agreement. They can change any number without evidence. If something's wrong later, you have no reference to claim against.

Professional money changers always provide this (even small ones)—it's standard practice and legal protection.

**What to do:**
- Ask before money is counted: "Can I get a slip showing the amount, rate, and total rupiah?"
- If they refuse or hesitate, cancel immediately
- Don't proceed without a slip—it's non-negotiable

### RED FLAG #3: You're Not Given Time to Recount

**What it is:**
After the operator counts and hands you money, they:
- Immediately say "Done, thank you, goodbye!"
- Try to move you out quickly
- Don't allow you time to verify the count
- Make you feel rushed or pressured to leave

**Why it's dangerous:**
Short-changing commonly happens here. They bet you won't recount at the counter, so you'll discover you're short only later (too late to claim).

**What to do:**
- Say firmly: "Wait, let me count first" and don't move
- Use your bundling verification method (see Article 2)
- Take your time; don't feel rushed
- If they show impatience or annoyance, recount extra carefully—that's a sign something's wrong

### RED FLAG #4: Distraction From Others (Team Distraction)

**What it is:**
While you're transacting:
- Someone suddenly appears to chat with you
- An uninvolved staff member stands nearby watching
- Sudden noise or commotion distracts you
- Pressure to hurry ("Don't take long, other customers waiting")

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is the "distraction team" scam technique. They make you lose focus while cash is being counted, so you don't know how much was actually counted.

**What to do:**
- Stop conversation firmly: "Excuse me, I need to focus on the money"
- If the person doesn't leave, ask the operator to remove them
- If they refuse your request, cancel the transaction
- Remember: you're the customer; the changer should accommodate your needs

### RED FLAG #5: Counting Is "Too Fast" or Piles Constantly Shuffled

**What it is:**
- Operator counts with extreme speed (flash counting)
- Piles are moved around constantly during counting
- You can't follow the amount being tallied
- No organized arrangement by denomination

**Why it's dangerous:**
Fast counting + shuffled piles = perfect setup for sleight of hand (palming notes). Some bills can disappear without you knowing.

**What to do:**
- Request organized counting: "Can you organize this by denomination?"
- Ask them to recount in a more orderly way
- If they refuse or say "not necessary," that's a red flag—cancel
- If they get visibly irritated at the request, something's definitely wrong

### RED FLAG #6: Fees or Charges Suddenly Appear

**What it is:**
- They quoted a good rate and promised a total rupiah amount
- Mid-transaction or at the end, new charges appear: "admin fee," "commission," "handling fee," or "tax"
- Your final amount is suddenly much less than promised

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is "bait and switch." They attract you with a good rate but hidden fees make the effective rate terrible—worse than competitors.

**Example:**
- Promised rate: Rp16.800 per USD
- Your amount: $300 = Rp5.040.000 (expected)
- Sudden "admin fee": Rp500.000
- You receive: Rp4.540.000 (effective rate: Rp15.133—much worse!)

**What to do:**
- Before handing money, ask: "Are there any fees or commissions?"
- If yes, ask details: "How much exactly?"
- Get the final amount (total rupiah) promised **before** cash is counted
- If fees are disappointing, cancel—don't proceed

### RED FLAG #7: Exchange Rate Changes Mid-Transaction

**What it is:**
- Initial agreement: Rate is Rp16.500 per USD
- Partway through (after money is in their hands), they announce:
  - "Your notes are actually older, so rate is lower"
  - "This denomination doesn't qualify for that rate"
  - "There's a fee I forgot to mention"

**Why it's dangerous:**
Pure psychological pressure. They're counting on you feeling "trapped" because your money is already with them, so you'll accept worse terms.

**What to do:**
- Immediately take your money back (before all of it is counted)
- Say clearly: "This is different from what we agreed. I'm canceling."
- Don't complete the transaction—walk to another changer
- If they resist giving your money back, this is very suspicious—ask for help or contact authorities

### RED FLAG #8: Location Feels Unsafe or Suspicious

**What it is:**
- Money changer is in a dark or isolated location
- No other people around (you're alone with staff)
- No visible security cameras or protection
- Looks like it's operating "under the table" (not formal)
- Staff seem hostile or unwelcoming from the start

**Why it's dangerous:**
Safe, legitimate places have security, CCTV, and other people. Sketchy locations indicate this isn't a formal operation.

**What to do:**
- Don't enter or leave immediately if you're inside
- Never exchange money here—risk is too high
- Find a changer in a busy area, mall, or inside a bank branch

### RED FLAG #9: They Can't Provide Correct Change

**What it is:**
- You request a specific denomination for your rupiah total
- They say "We don't have that denomination right now"
- They suggest you take different denominations instead
- Or they ask you to come back later

**Why it's dangerous:**
Serious money changers always have adequate denominations. If they can't, it signals:
- They're not a formal operation
- They're trying to avoid giving you what you negotiated
- Something's off about their setup

**What to do:**
- Don't compromise—you have the right to your requested denominations
- If they truly can't accommodate, find another changer
- Don't accept an "alternative"; you earned the right to choose

## How to Exit Gracefully

If you detect red flags and want to cancel:

**Method #1: Polite Decline**
- "Thank you, but I'll try another place"
- Or: "I appreciate it, but I'll look elsewhere"
- No need to explain details
- Just say thanks and leave

**Method #2: The "Let Me Check" Exit**
- "Let me quickly compare rates at another changer nearby"
- Leave and don't return
- Makes them feel less rejected

**Method #3: Direct but Professional**
- If already counting: "There's a discrepancy. I'm canceling this transaction."
- Not accusatory—just factual
- Take your money back and leave

**Method #4: If They Resist**
- If they won't return your money, stay calm
- Request it clearly: "Please return my currency"
- If still refused, contact your accommodation or police
- This is a very bad sign

## Don't Feel Guilty About Walking Away

This is critical: **You don't owe these people anything until the full exchange is complete.**

- Other changers are always nearby
- You're not obligated to complete any transaction
- Your safety instinct about "something being wrong" is usually correct
- Canceling is the smart choice, not a rude one

Many tourists complete sketchy transactions out of guilt or politeness, then get scammed. Don't be that person.

## Quick Decision Flowchart (Memorize This)

```
Licensed changer (PVA Berizin + visible certificate)?
├─ NO → WALK AWAY immediately
└─ YES → Check other red flags:
   ├─ Rate "too good" / no slip / rushed / distracted / fast counting
   ├─ / sudden fees / rate change / unsafe location / no proper change?
   │  ├─ YES (any of these) → WALK AWAY
   │  └─ NO (none of these) → Proceed (use 3-step counting method)
   └─ Done
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **License is the baseline** – PVA Berizin logo and certificate visible = eligible; otherwise, walk away
2. **"Too good" rates are bait** – Check real-time app rates; if it's too high, so is the risk
3. **Written receipt is essential** – Never proceed without one; cancel if refused
4. **Distraction and pressure = red flags** – Cancel both
5. **Fast counting + shuffled piles = setup for fraud** – Request organized, orderly counting
6. **Sudden fees are never good** – Know your final amount before any cash moves
7. **Rate changes mid-transaction = abort** – Get your money back immediately
8. **Unsafe location = don't go** – Find a changer in a secure, busy area
9. **Don't feel obligated to proceed** – Walking away is the right choice if something feels off
10. **Other options always exist** – Never force yourself to use a suspicious changer out of convenience

## Final Word

Most currency exchange scams can be prevented by making the **right decision early**. Don't rely on hope or trust in kindness—use protocols, written evidence, and your instinct. If it feels wrong, it probably is. Walk away. No one will blame you, and you'll avoid a bad situation. Walking away is the safest, smartest move you can make.
