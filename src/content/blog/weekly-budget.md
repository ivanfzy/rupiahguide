# How to Plan Your Cash Needs for a Week in Indonesia

## Why planning cash for a week (not daily) matters

Most travelers make one of two mistakes: they withdraw cash erratically ("I'll grab some when I need it") and end up at ATMs constantly, or they withdraw too much upfront and carry excessive risk. Neither is ideal.

Planning cash for one week gives you a clear withdrawal strategy that minimizes ATM visits (saving time and fees), reduces risk from carrying too much, and lets you manage your itinerary without worrying about money.

This article teaches you how to calculate your exact cash needs for a week, structured by activity level and spending pattern.

## Step 1: Know Your Daily Budget (From Your Travel Style)

First, refer to Article 4.1 and identify which budget profile matches you:

- **Budget traveler:** $50 USD/day (Rp825.000/day)
- **Mid-range traveler:** $100 USD/day (Rp1.650.000/day)
- **Luxury traveler:** $200 USD/day (Rp3.300.000/day)

For planning, round to nearest Rp50.000 for simplicity:
- Budget: Rp800.000/day
- Mid-range: Rp1.650.000/day
- Luxury: Rp3.300.000/day

## Step 2: Account for Variable Costs

Your daily budget isn't uniform—some days are cheaper (rest days, no activities), some are expensive (paid tours, nice dinners). Plan for this variation.

**Identify high-expense days:**
- Days with paid activities (tours, classes, adventure sports): add Rp300.000–600.000
- Days with nicer dining: add Rp100.000–300.000
- Days with special purchases (souvenirs, shopping): add Rp200.000–500.000

**Identify low-expense days:**
- Beach/hiking days (free natural activities): subtract Rp100.000–200.000
- Days eating street food only: subtract Rp50.000–100.000
- Days without transport needs (resting at accommodation): subtract Rp50.000–150.000

**Example week structure:**

| Day | Activity | Daily Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Arrival + explore | Rp1.650.000 | Normal budget traveler day |
| Day 2 | Beach day (free) | Rp1.450.000 | Save Rp200.000 (no activities, simple food) |
| Day 3 | Paid tour | Rp2.300.000 | Add Rp650.000 for tour |
| Day 4 | Spa + nice dinner | Rp2.000.000 | Add Rp350.000 for spa + upscale meal |
| Day 5 | Rest day | Rp1.200.000 | Save Rp450.000 (minimal movement, cheap food) |
| Day 6 | Cooking class + shopping | Rp2.450.000 | Add Rp800.000 (cooking class + souvenir budget) |
| Day 7 | Departure | Rp800.000 | Only breakfast + minimal activity |
| **WEEK TOTAL** | | **Rp11.850.000** | **~$718 USD** |

## Step 3: Calculate Total Weekly Cash Need

**Simple formula:**

```
(Daily budget × 7 days) + Activity surcharges - Budget savings = Weekly cash needed
```

**Using the example above:**

```
(Rp1.650.000 × 7) + [Rp650.000 + Rp350.000 + Rp800.000] - [Rp200.000 + Rp450.000]
= Rp11.550.000 + Rp1.800.000 - Rp650.000
= Rp12.700.000
```

Round to Rp12.700.000 for convenience.

## Step 4: Add Safety Buffer (10–15%)

Never plan your cash to exactly zero—unexpected expenses always happen.

```
Weekly total × 1.10 (for 10% buffer) = Final amount to withdraw
```

**Using the example:**

```
Rp12.700.000 × 1.10 = Rp13.970.000
```

Round to Rp14.000.000 for easy mental math.

## Step 5: Request Proper Denominations When Withdrawing

When you withdraw Rp14.000.000, request a mix that works for your week:

**For budget/mid-range travelers:**
- Rp100.000 × 8 notes = Rp800.000 (for medium purchases, emergency)
- Rp50.000 × 12 notes = Rp600.000 (for meals, transport)
- Rp20.000 × 10 notes = Rp200.000 (for market, warung)
- Rp10.000 × 10 notes = Rp100.000 (for small items, tips)
- Rp5.000 × 20 notes = Rp100.000 (for tips, donations, small buys)
- Remaining: smaller denominations or additional Rp50.000 notes

**For luxury travelers:**
- Rp100.000 × 20 notes = Rp2.000.000
- Rp50.000 × 15 notes = Rp750.000
- Rp20.000 × 10 notes = Rp200.000
- Rp10.000 × 10 notes = Rp100.000
- Rest in appropriate denominations

## Real-World Example: 7-Day Trip Planning

### Scenario: Mid-Range Traveler, 1 Week

**Itinerary:**
- Days 1–2: Arrival, exploration, beach
- Day 3: Paid snorkeling tour (Rp700.000)
- Day 4: Spa day + nice dinner (Rp500.000 total)
- Day 5: Cooking class (Rp400.000)
- Days 6–7: Light activity, departure

**Calculation:**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Base daily budget × 7 days | Rp11.550.000 |
| Snorkeling tour surcharge | Rp700.000 |
| Spa + nice dinner surcharge | Rp500.000 |
| Cooking class surcharge | Rp400.000 |
| Subtotal | Rp13.150.000 |
| 10% safety buffer | Rp1.315.000 |
| **Total to withdraw** | **Rp14.465.000** |

**Round to:** Rp14.500.000 for easy tracking

**Withdrawal request:** "I'd like Rp14.500.000 in a mix: several Rp100.000, several Rp50.000, some Rp20.000, and smaller denominations."

## Alternative: The "Periodic Withdrawal" Strategy

Instead of withdrawing for the full week, some travelers prefer smaller, more frequent withdrawals:

**Weekly withdrawals (recommended):**
- Pros: Fewer ATM visits, less cash carried, clear weekly budget
- Cons: Requires planning itinerary upfront

**Bi-weekly withdrawals:**
- For 2-week+ trips
- Pros: Even fewer ATM visits, simpler accounting
- Cons: Must carry more cash, less flexibility mid-period

**3-4 day withdrawals:**
- For highly flexible/unplanned trips
- Pros: Always have minimal cash, very flexible itinerary
- Cons: Constant ATM hunting, pays fees frequently, disruptive

**Recommendation:** Weekly withdrawal is the balance between convenience and flexibility for most travelers.

## Special Scenarios

### Multi-City Trip (7 Days Across 3 Cities)

When you're moving between cities, plan cash per city:

**City 1 (3 days): Rp4.500.000**
- Daily base: Rp1.500.000 × 3 = Rp4.500.000
- No activities (exploring only)

**City 2 (2 days): Rp3.800.000**
- Daily base: Rp1.500.000 × 2 = Rp3.000.000
- Paid tour: Rp800.000
- Total: Rp3.800.000

**City 3 (2 days): Rp3.300.000**
- Daily base: Rp1.500.000 × 2 = Rp3.000.000
- Departure day (less spending): Rp300.000

**Total for 7 days: Rp11.600.000 + 10% buffer = Rp12.760.000**

**Strategy:** 
- Withdraw Rp5.000.000 before entering City 1
- Withdraw Rp4.000.000 before entering City 2 (City 1 remaining + City 2 need)
- Carry remaining for City 3

### Return Home (Last Day)

Leave minimal cash for final day. End-of-trip leftover rupiah is common and expected—you can:
- Leave as tip for housekeeping
- Donate at temples
- Use at airport shops/restaurants
- Exchange back (though at worse rates than in-city)

**Plan to have 0–Rp200.000 remaining on your final day.** If you have more, adjust your Week 7 planned spending upward.

## Common Planning Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Mistake #1: Forgetting accommodation in your budget**
- This article assumes accommodation is pre-booked separately
- If not, add accommodation per night to your daily budget calculation

**Mistake #2: Underestimating activity costs**
- Paid tours/activities can be Rp500.000–1.000.000+
- If you plan 2–3 activities per week, this is significant
- Be realistic about what you'll actually do

**Mistake #3: Assuming consistent daily spending**
- Real weeks have high-spend days and low-spend days
- Don't use a flat average—account for variation

**Mistake #4: Not including transport between cities**
- If traveling to other cities, add:
  - Flight: Rp500.000–2.000.000 (if booked in-country)
  - Bus: Rp100.000–500.000
  - Train: Rp100.000–300.000
- These can swing your weekly budget significantly

**Mistake #5: Withdrawing too much and then overspending**
- Carrying Rp30.000.000 makes you feel rich—and you'll spend like it
- Stick to your planned amount; carry only what you calculated

## The Math-Free Shortcut

If all this math feels tedious, here's a simple rule:

```
(Daily budget × 7) + Rp2.000.000 (for activities) + 10% buffer
```

**Using this shortcut:**

- Budget traveler: (Rp800.000 × 7) + Rp2.000.000 + 10% = Rp7.980.000 → round to **Rp8.000.000**
- Mid-range: (Rp1.650.000 × 7) + Rp2.000.000 + 10% = **Rp14.465.000** → round to **Rp14.500.000**
- Luxury: (Rp3.300.000 × 7) + Rp2.000.000 + 10% = **Rp27.730.000** → round to **Rp28.000.000**

This covers baseline + moderate activities + buffer. If you plan heavy activity weeks, add another Rp2.000.000–5.000.000.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with your daily budget** – Know if you're $50, $100, or $200/day
2. **Account for activity surcharges** – Paid tours/spas aren't "extra"; they're planned expenses
3. **Plan for variable spending** – High days and low days balance out; don't use daily average for weekly
4. **Add 10–15% safety buffer** – Unexpected costs always happen
5. **Request proper denominations** – Withdraw with a mix so you can spend without breaking large notes
6. **One withdrawal per week is ideal** – Balances convenience vs. flexibility for most travelers
7. **Carry only what you planned** – Excess cash = overspending temptation
8. **Account for city transitions** – Moving between cities changes costs and ATM access
9. **Leave room for end-of-trip remainder** – Some leftover rupiah is normal and fine
10. **Track actual spending for 2–3 days** – Then adjust your estimate if needed

Planning cash by the week turns a vague concern ("How much do I need?") into a concrete number you can withdraw and manage. It's boring accounting, but it eliminates cash-related stress for the entire trip.
