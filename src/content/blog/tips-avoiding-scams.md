# Tips for Avoiding Money Changer Scams

Bali and other tourist spots are amazing, but you need to be careful when exchanging money.

## Red Flags 🚩

*   **Rates too good to be true**: If the rate is higher than Google, it's a scam.
*   **Commission fees**: Legitimate authorized changers usually don't charge commission, but check first.
*   **Sleight of hand**: Always count your money *last*, right in front of them, and don't let them touch it again.

## Safe Places

Look for **"Authorized Money Changer"** signs with a green shield logo (PVA Berizin).
