Every year, tens of thousands of counterfeit rupiah notes circulate in Indonesia. Fortunately, as a tourist, your risk is relatively low if you know what to look for. Most fakes originate from unofficial money changers and street traders—not authorized exchanges. Learning to spot them takes 2 minutes and can save you from losing money or worse, trying to use counterfeit notes (which is illegal).

This article walks you through the real security features on genuine Indonesian rupiah notes, so you can inspect notes on the spot—at money changers, markets, or taxis.

### The 11 Security Features on Genuine Rupiah Banknotes

Indonesian rupiah notes employ sophisticated anti-counterfeiting technology. Here are the key features you should know:

#### 1. Watermark (The Most Important Feature)

**What it is:** A faint image visible when you hold the note up to light.

**How to check it:**
- Hold the note up to bright light or sunlight
- You should see a portrait matching the hero on the note, plus denomination numerals
- The watermark should be on BOTH sides of the note
- On genuine notes, the watermark appears silvery and clear

**Fake Red Flags:**
- Watermark is blurry or barely visible
- Watermark doesn't match the person on the front
- Watermark appears on only one side
- Watermark looks printed rather than created within the paper itself

#### 2. Security Thread (The Embedded Strip)

**What it is:** A thin, shiny metallic or colored strip running vertically through the center of the note.

**How to check it:**
- Look at the note from the front—you should see a clear strip
- Tilt the note and the strip should change appearance (color-shifting effect)
- Try to scratch it—a genuine security thread is absolutely not removable; it's embedded in the paper
- On 2022 series notes, this thread has micro-text when viewed under UV light

**Fake Red Flags:**
- The thread is loose or can be peeled off
- The thread doesn't change color when tilted
- The strip looks like it was glued on

#### 3. Color-Shifting Ink (OVI - Optically Variable Ink)

**What it is:** Ink that changes color depending on the angle you view it.

**How to check it:**
- On newer 2022 series notes, look at the denominations in the bottom-right corner
- Tilt the note back and forth
- The color should shift from one hue to another (typically green to gold, or purple to green)
- This effect is smooth and continuous

**Fake Red Flags:**
- Color doesn't change when tilted
- Ink appears flat and one-colored
- Color change is abrupt or uneven instead of smooth

#### 4. Microtext (Tiny Printed Text)

**What it is:** Extremely small text (often the denomination or "Bank Indonesia") visible only with magnification.

**How to check it:**
- Use a magnifying glass or zoom in with your phone camera
- Look along the borders and around security areas
- The text should be perfectly legible when magnified
- On genuine notes, the microtext is crisp and clean

**Fake Red Flags:**
- Microtext is blurry or illegible when magnified
- Text appears broken or incomplete
- Microtext is missing entirely

#### 5. Latent Image (Hidden Image Feature)

**What it is:** An image that appears when you tilt the note at specific angles.

**How to check it:**
- Hold the note at a steep angle (nearly flat)
- Look at designated security areas
- A hidden image should appear or disappear as you tilt
- This is particularly prominent on higher denominations (Rp50.000 and Rp100.000)

**Fake Red Flags:**
- No image appears when tilting
- Image appears permanently rather than only at certain angles
- Image quality is poor or distorted

#### 6. Intaglio Printing (Raised, Tactile Surface)

**What it is:** A special printing technique that creates raised areas you can feel with your fingers.

**How to check it:**
- Run your finger across the note, especially over portraits and denominations
- Genuine notes have noticeable raised areas that feel like embossing
- This is one of the easiest tests to perform without special equipment

**Fake Red Flags:**
- The note is completely smooth—no raised texture
- Printed areas feel flat or identical to non-printed areas
- The texture is irregular or patchy

#### 7. Hologram or Iridescent Elements

**What it is:** Special areas that reflect light like a hologram.

**How to check it:**
- Look for shiny, reflective patches on the note
- Tilt the note—these areas should shimmer and change appearance
- On 2022 series notes, look for iridescent areas with enhanced security elements

**Fake Red Flags:**
- No shimmering or reflective areas
- "Hologram" areas are completely flat
- Reflective patches are peeling or scratched

#### 8. Serial Numbers (Complex Security Feature)

**What it is:** The unique alphanumeric codes printed on the note.

**How to check it:**
- Examine the serial number with a magnifying glass
- The printing should be perfectly straight and uniform
- Look for color variations in the ink (some serial numbers use color-shifting ink)
- The numbers should be clearly legible and consistent throughout

**Fake Red Flags:**
- Serial numbers are crooked or uneven
- Numbers are blurry or poorly printed
- Different parts of the serial number have inconsistent quality

#### 9. Bleed-Through Resistance (Hidden Print)

**What it is:** Special ink that doesn't bleed through to the back of the note.

**How to check it:**
- Look at the back of the note where images appear on the front
- The images shouldn't be heavily visible from the reverse side
- Some details will show through slightly (this is normal), but clarity should be limited

**Fake Red Flags:**
- Images are extremely dark or clear on both sides
- Ink appears to have soaked through the paper
- The back looks like a mirror image of the front

#### 10. UV Reactive Features (Invisible Ink)

**What it is:** Images or security text that only appear under ultraviolet (UV) light.

**How to check it:**
- Hold the note under a UV light or use your phone's blacklight feature
- Specific areas should glow or display hidden information
- The UV patterns are very specific to each denomination
- This is most effective on 2022 series notes

**Practical Note:** Most tourists won't have UV lights with them, so this is more of a "if you have access" feature. However, many authorized money changers use UV lights during transactions.

**Fake Red Flags:**
- No response to UV light in areas where features should appear
- Unexpected glowing or patterns that don't match known designs

#### 11. Paper Quality and Texture

**What it is:** Indonesian rupiah notes are printed on special banknote paper made from cotton and plant fibers, not regular pulp paper.

**How to check it:**
- Feel the note—genuine rupiah paper is distinctly firm and has a unique texture
- It doesn't feel like regular printer paper
- The note should feel slightly waxy or smooth, with a consistent weight throughout
- Tear resistance: if you fold a note repeatedly, it won't tear easily (it will eventually, but it's more durable than normal paper)

**Fake Red Flags:**
- The note feels thin or flimsy like regular paper
- It tears easily or feels brittle
- The texture is inconsistent—some parts feel different from others

### The 5-Second Fake Check: A Quick Practical Method

When you're at a money changer or market, you don't have time for a full inspection. Here's a 5-second protocol:

1. **Feel for raised texture** (Intaglio printing) - Run your finger over the portrait. It should feel bumpy. (2 seconds)
2. **Hold to light** - Look for a clear watermark matching the denominations. (2 seconds)
3. **Tilt for color shift** - Check the security thread or OVI areas for color change when tilted. (1 second)

If all three pass, the note is almost certainly genuine.

### Real Risks: Where Counterfeits Come From

**High-Risk Situations:**
- Street money changers offering "better rates"
- Unlicensed money exchangers (not displaying the "Bank Indonesia PVA Berizin" logo)
- Private ATMs in tourist areas that feel suspicious
- Receiving change from informal vendors (though most are honest)

**Low-Risk Situations:**
- Authorized money changers (they have security verification systems)
- Bank ATMs (virtually impossible to get counterfeits)
- Official banks
- Reputable hotels

### What To Do If You Suspect a Counterfeit Note

**Immediate Action:**
1. Don't try to use it—it's illegal to knowingly pass counterfeit currency
2. Don't spend it at another vendor hoping they won't notice
3. Instead, immediately return to the place where you received it
4. Politely show the note and explain you believe it's counterfeit
5. Ask for a replacement or refund

**At a Money Changer:**
- Most authorized money changers are professional and honest
- If you catch a problem, they'll typically replace it immediately to protect their reputation
- Authorized changers use UV light verification regularly

**If You Can't Return It:**
- Contact your hotel concierge—they often help with currency issues
- Visit a Bank Indonesia office (though this is rarely necessary)
- Report it to local police if the amount is significant (though this is mainly a formality)

### Counterfeit Statistics (What Actually Happens)

According to recent studies on Indonesian currency, the most counterfeited denominations are:
1. **Rp100.000** - The most common note, so counterfeits are more impactful
2. **Rp50.000** - High-value enough to be profitable for counterfeiters
3. **Rp20.000** - Lower denominations have lower detection rates

The counterfeiting rate in Indonesia is estimated at less than 0.1%—meaning out of 1.000 notes, fewer than 1 is typically counterfeit. Your actual risk as a tourist using authorized money changers is extremely low.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Learn the feel** - Raised intaglio texture is the easiest feature to verify on the spot
2. **Use the watermark test** - Holding to light is quick and effective
3. **Use authorized changers** - This eliminates 99%+ of counterfeit risk
4. **Don't panic** - Modern rupiah notes have sophisticated security; fakes are rare when you use legitimate sources
5. **Trust your instincts** - If a deal seems too good or a vendor seems sketchy, use a different money changer
