Currency exchange scams typically happen because of two factors: rates that look "too good to be true," and the speed of counting cash combined with deliberate distractions. The good news is that most of this risk can be drastically reduced if you only exchange at licensed operators and always recount your money before leaving the counter.

## Safety baseline (before we list the scams)

- Choose a licensed money changer: look for the "PVA Berizin / Pedagang Valuta Asing Berizin" logo (Bank Indonesia licensed) and displayed business authorization documents.
- If the rate offered is "much higher than normal" and feels too good, treat that as your first red flag.
- Request a written receipt (slip) showing the amount of foreign currency, the exchange rate, and the total rupiah you'll receive—this is standard practice for reputable changers.

## The 10 Most Common Scams (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1) "Too-Good-to-Be-True Rate" (Bait Rate)

**How it works:** The display board shows a rate far above market rate to attract you inside. Once you hand over money, the rate changes or hidden commissions appear.

**How to avoid it:**
- Quickly compare against mid-market rate on an app like XE or OANDA
- If the difference is unreasonable (more than 2–3% from mid-market), leave the place
- Ask directly before handing over money: "What's my final rate after all fees?"

**Red flag example:** A rate 5–10% higher than competitors in the same area signals something is wrong.

### 2) Sleight of Hand (Notes "Disappear" During Counting)

**How it works:** Cash is counted quickly in front of you, then a few notes are "palmed" or concealed before being handed to you. The operator relies on you not being focused or being tired.

**How to avoid it:**
- Request money organized by denomination (all Rp100.000 separate, all Rp50.000 separate, etc.)
- Count it yourself at the counter before putting it in your wallet
- If they won't organize it by denomination, that's a red flag—cancel

### 3) "Distraction Team" (Someone Else Diverts Your Attention)

**How it works:** One or more people suddenly appear to chat with you, engage you in conversation, or create noise while your money is being counted.

**How to avoid it:**
- Stop all conversation firmly: "I need to focus on the money"
- If distractions continue, ask the operator to remove the person
- If they refuse, cancel the transaction

### 4) "Recount Loop" (Counting Repeatedly Until You're Tired)

**How it works:** The operator deliberately repeats counting and shuffles the piles so you lose track of the total. They're counting on you giving up from fatigue.

**How to avoid it:**
- Request one count, then you recount using your own method
- If numbers don't match, recount again your way—don't have them do it again
- Write the total on your phone or paper before leaving

### 5) "Commission/Tax Surprise" (Fees That Appear Mid-Transaction)

**How it works:** The rate looks good on the board, but mid-transaction "commission," "admin fee," or "tax" suddenly appears, making the effective rate much worse.

**How to avoid it:**
- Ask before handing over money: "Any fees or commission?"
- Request the final amount (total rupiah) before any counting begins
- If fees appear that surprise you, cancel the transaction —don't proceed

### 6) "Different Rate for Different Denominations" (Rate Varies by Bill Size)

**How it works:** Good rate only applies to certain denominations (e.g., large bills), while smaller bills get a worse rate without warning.

**How to avoid it:**
- Confirm the rate applies to your specific bills before handing them over
- Ask: "Will this rate apply to ALL my currency?"
- Request total rupiah amount calculated before any cash is counted

### 7) "Old/Damaged Bill Excuse" (Your Foreign Cash Is Suddenly "Bad")

**How it works:** After you hand over your currency, they claim it's old, creased, or stained, so they reduce the rate unilaterally.

**How to avoid it:**
- Agree on the rate and bill condition **before** handing over your money
- Show your cash before the transaction and ask: "Is this OK for this rate?"
- If they change terms after you hand money over, take it back and leave

### 8) "Calculator Switch" (Numbers Mysteriously Change)

**How it works:** The operator types quickly or deletes numbers while you're not watching, then shows you a lower total than correct.

**How to avoid it:**
- Calculate the total yourself on your phone and match it against their calculator
- Don't just trust their screen—ask them to show you their calculation written down
- Request a written receipt with the foreign amount, rate, and total rupiah

### 9) "Shorted Notes in Small Denominations" (You're Underpaid Subtly)

**How it works:** You expect Rp2.000.000 but receive only Rp1.500.000 because the mix of small denominations makes it hard to track the total. They bet you'll count at home, not at the counter.

**How to avoid it:**
- Request large denominations first (Rp100.000 or Rp50.000), then smaller ones
- Always count the total yourself before leaving the counter—this is non-negotiable
- If there's a discrepancy, tell them immediately before you leave

### 10) "Pressure to Accept Quickly" (Rushed Out Before You Notice)

**How it works:** After money is handed to you, they quickly say "Done, thank you!" with a tone that ends the transaction, hoping you'll leave before realizing it's short.

**How to avoid it:**
- Take your time counting—don't feel rushed
- Stand at the counter until you've finished verification
- If they show impatience, recount more carefully—that's a sign something's off
- Remember: you're the customer; they must serve you, not rush you

## Simple Safety Checklist (You Can Print This)

**Before Exchanging:**
- ☐ Check for licensed sign (PVA Berizin logo, business authorization displayed)
- ☐ Compare rate on app against their board
- ☐ Rate is not "too good" (use real-time apps to verify)

**During Exchange:**
- ☐ Request written receipt (nominal, rate, total rupiah)
- ☐ Ask "Any fees or commission?"
- ☐ Recount before you leave
- ☐ Cancel if there's distraction or pressure

**If There's a Problem:**
- ☐ Stay calm; recount carefully
- ☐ Compare your phone calculation with receipt
- ☐ If numbers still don't match, cancel **before you leave the counter**

## If You Suspect Short-Changing

Stay calm, stop the process, and explain the discrepancy using numbers, not emotion. Ask them to recount your way (by denomination, organized). If it still doesn't match, cancel the transaction before the money fully changes hands—after you leave, it's very hard to prove.

Remember: you don't have to complete any transaction that feels wrong. There's another money changer nearby.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Licensed exchange is your first baseline** – No license visible = don't exchange here
2. **"Too good" rates are bait** – Compare against real-time apps; don't trust their board alone
3. **Written receipt is non-negotiable** – Always get one before money is counted
4. **Distraction and pressure = red flags** – Cancel if either occurs
5. **Fast counting + shuffled piles = setup for fraud** – Request organized counting and take your time
6. **Surprise fees are never good** – Know your final total before any cash moves
7. **Rate changes mid-transaction = immediate abort** – Take your money back and leave
8. **Your instinct matters** – If it feels wrong, it probably is
9. **Don't complete transactions out of politeness** – Your safety matters more than courtesy
10. **Always other options exist** – Never force yourself to use a suspicious changer

Exchange scams are largely avoidable with early awareness and consistent counting protocols. There's nothing awkward about protecting your money from the start.
